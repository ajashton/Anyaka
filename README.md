# Anyaka

*Adwaita* - the name of the default GNOME 3 theme - is Sanskrit for *one and only*. *Anyaka* is Sanskrit for *another*.

**NOTE**: The Anyaka Metacity theme hides the entire window decoration for maximized windows. The default shortcut to un-maximize a window is Alt-F10. You can also click and drag anywhere on a maximized window while holding Alt to un-maxize it.
